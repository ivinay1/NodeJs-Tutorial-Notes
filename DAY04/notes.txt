Dynamic content and Templates
1.) Managing data(without database)
2.) render dynamic content in our views
3.) understanding templating engines

we can store data and share it using JS variables like products but it has a disadvantage i.e, if we will made a new brand new request from a new machine (you can also achieve this by opeining the same localhost:3000 server in a diff browser as it shares same IP but cookies and all are new and it will be like reuqest is made form a new mahine)
this data stored in JS variable is inherent to our node server as it is running therefore it is shared across all the users
sometimes this is what we want but mostly times we don't it is very rarely. Generally we fetch data for a specific request and if that happens to be the same data you show for all users that send this request this is fine. but sharing data across request across users is typically something we dont wanna do

Templating engines
HTMLish Template is passed to Templating engine where is understands it and replaced the placeholders/Snippets withh real HTML Content generated by templating engine
on the fly on the server on the templating engine taking dynamic content into account

some templatng engines
1.) EJS
2.) Pug(jade)  --> works on indentation
3.) handlebars  --> not autoinstalled by express. so we manually have to tell express that such express handlebar engine is available 

app.set(key,'value') is used to set global configuration value ---> it allows us to set any value globally on our express application 
app.get(key) is used to get the configuration value

the major diff between pug and handlebar template is we can't run any logical / conditional things in the template on the other hand we can run logical and conditional things inside the pug template

we can just output single properties and single variables , single values only

this acts as a advantage in handlebars as we can write logic things into in the server side and only the output part in the templates

we can use 'this' keyword to refer to the current object in handlebar
(less logic in the template more logic in the server code)

concept of layout is supported in handlebars also like pug

layout : "False" ==> is key value we will pass if then handlebar engine will not use default layout

EJS and pug are supported by expres out of the box so we don't have to register it like handlebar
